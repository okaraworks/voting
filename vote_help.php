Once logged in, you will be able to cast your vote. <br> You can only vote once and you cannot submit an empty 'ballot paper'-you have to select a candidate from the given list before you can proceed to the next 'ballot paper'. <br><br> The 'ballot papers' are organized beginning from the SGC posts, to the Congress posts of the respective academic divisions (faculties and schools) then finally the Congress posts of the respective halls of residence. <br><br> Once you have made your selections, the final list of your choices is displayed from which you can decide to either submit it or go back and edit your selections before finally submitting the list. <br><br> Once you have submitted the list, you cannot revert this action since you will have already voted.
